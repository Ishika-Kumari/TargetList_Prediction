# TargetList_Prediction
In this Machine Learning Project we will be training a machince learning model to predict which clients of a banking firm are likely to open a "term deposit" when approached. And using this trained model we will be predicting a target list of 1000 clients to be approached for the campaign for "term deposit" subscription.
For this we used tools and packages like MS Excel, Jupyter Notebook, Tableau, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn for cleaning, analyzing the data and then training various classification models like DecisionTree , XGB Classifier, Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, etc using the cleaned data.
